## Double-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) 

### Input
The features were recognized with spatial correlation range, and input to different size of convolution kernel.

The input files included features of population data, check-in data, POIs, spatial competition index, and road network density. 

### Output
The output was the total monthly sales of all the retail stores in the region, and a model was constructed to express the relationship between market demand and site selection factors.
